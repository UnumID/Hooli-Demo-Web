# README: Kredita Web Demo

## Overview

> This project acts as a simple web application for a fictional customer, Kredita, which uses Unum ID for 1-click ID - accepting [credentials](https://docs.unumid.co/terminology#credential) issued by Hooli. Additional information on how to enable 1-click IDV can be found [here](http://localhost:3000/quick-start-guide).

The Kredita Web Demo is implemented using the [Remix](https://remix.run/docs) full stack web framework. Additional information about the Unum ID demo ecosystem can be found in our [documentation](https://docs.unumid.co/hooli-demo-idv).
